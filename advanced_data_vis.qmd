# Part 1. Understand the context

**a) Learn about tidy tuesday**

**b) Dissect someone else's visualization**

Benjamin uses the "MoMAColors" and "MetBrewer" packages to add color palattes inspired by artwork to his project, "ggstream" to create his figure, which is known as a stream plot, and "patchwork" to easily combine plots. He cleans the data using drop_na to remove rows with missing values and lubridate to modify dates, then converts the number of each type of trash found to its total weight; the data frame contains columns for date, trash wheel, type of trash, weight, and total number of trash objects. He uses geom_stream to generate most of his plot, geom_vline to create vertical lines denoting years, and geom_textbox to add an annotation.

Nikos uses the "stringr" package to make working with strings easier, "data.table" to improve upon base R's data frame structure, and "rnaturalearth", "rnaturalearthdata", and "rnaturalearthhires" to map data onto map visuals, as well as "ggrepel" to prevent overlapping text labels in ggplot. The data are cleaned by grouping players according to birth country and province (for players born in Canada) - there are multiple data frames: one for all NHL players, giving their name, birthday, and place of birth and another for only Canadian players, giving their province of birth.. The bar plot uses geom_col, which makes the heights of bars representative of the values of the underlying data instead of count and geom_text to label the bars. The larger plot uses geom_sf to assign data onto the map of Canada and coord_sf to specify the area that should be shown, as well as geom_text_repel to ensure that text does not overlap.

[![Nicola Rennie: Objects Launched Into Space](vis3.jpg)](https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday/blob/main/2024/2024-04-23/20240423.R)

Nicola uses "ggimage" to add images to ggplot, "ggforce" to add more plot customization options, and "glue" to insert variables into strings (it is also part of the "stringr" package). She mutates the data to assign each year to a specific angle on the circlular graph and uses pivot_longer and pivot_wider to reformat the data; the frame includes the aggregate number of objects sent into space by all countries by year. She uses geom_circle to create the circular base of the plot, geom_line to plot the lines extending out from the center, geom_point to add a dot to the end of each line, geom_text to add years to each line, and geom_image to add pictures.
